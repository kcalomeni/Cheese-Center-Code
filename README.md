# Cheese-Center-Code

I created this code as part of an assignment to compute the total number of profits and costs of cheese containers. The user inputs their own values into the program to receive a total of what the costs will be with their given numbers. I decided to go with the name "Cheese Center" because I wanted to add a fun and creative feel to a more simplistic type of code. I had a lot of fun with this and I love adding my own personal touch to give the program more originality.
